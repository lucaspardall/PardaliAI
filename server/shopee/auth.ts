I will apply the changes to the `server/shopee/auth.ts` file, focusing on correcting the signature generation for OAuth authorization, adjusting the OAuth URL generation with the correct parameter format, and adding detailed logging for signature debugging. I will also incorporate the changes related to obtaining the access token with the correct signature and validating required environment variables.
